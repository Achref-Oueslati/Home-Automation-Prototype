# Home-Automation-Prototype
This project enables home automation using an ESP32 with sensors and the Blynk app for real-time control. The project uses: 

Temperature, Humidity, and Gas/Fire Detection: Monitors environmental conditions.
Alarm Trigger: Activates if gas levels exceed a threshold.
Motion-Based Lighting: Turns lights on when motion is detected and off when the room is empty.
Garage Door Automation: Controls opening and closing via the Blynk app.
Blynk Integration: Displays real-time sensor data in the Blynk app and provides controls.

### Libraries
- Blynk Library
- DHT Sensor Library
